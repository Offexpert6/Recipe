2. In a large skillet, preheat 2-3 tablespoons of oil to medium heat for 2-3 minutes.

3. Sear the beef on all sides, stirring as needed, about 10 minutes. Add the onions, 1/2 of the slices serranos and garlic. Add a pinch of salt and pepper. Saute for 2-3 minutes.

4. Add 3/4 of the diced tomatoes and Maggi sauce. Stir well to combine. Add another pinch of salt and pepper. Cover and reduce heat slightly.

5. Transfer the remaining diced tomato to the blender. Add 1/3 cup of water, oregano and a pinch of salt. Blend on high until smooth. Pour into skillet. Stir well to combine. When it comes to a simmer, taste for seasoning. Cover and continue cooking at a low simmer for 25 minutes. If it's too dry-looking, you could add a little more water. Garnish with remaining slices of serranos and chopped cilantro before serving.
